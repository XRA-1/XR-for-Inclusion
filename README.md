# Project Overview 

The XR for Inclusivity project is a collection of resources hosted by XR Association (XRA), that provides a central place for developers to find solutions for creating projects that are accessible and represent all people. XRA is inspired by developers and XR programs and seeks to ensure that projects created for XR technology reflect authentic depictions of diverse communities and access to the programs are inclusive for all people. 

The XR Association promotes the dynamic global growth of the XR industry, which includes virtual reality, augmented reality, mixed-reality, and future immersive technology. XRA is leading the way for the responsible development and adoption of XR by convening stakeholders, developing best practices and research, and advocating on behalf of our members and the greater XR industry.

The XR Association represents the broad ecosystem of the XR industry including headset manufacturers, technology platforms, component and peripheral companies, internet infrastructure companies, enterprise solution providers, and corporate end-users. 

Diverse representation and accessible features are crucial to an XR experience because the program can be utilized by more individuals, which results in both business and creative benefits. Additionally, more representation of diverse communities in such immersive experiences is a significant factor because users will see themselves more in the program, resulting in a more personal and positive experience overall. 
Below you’ll find a summary of work stemming from the XRAC process, where XRA convened subject matter experts to discuss the most pressing issues facing immersive technology today, and accessibility was one of them. https://xra.org/xrac/

Contributions Welcome

The XR for Inclusion Project is open source. If you know of resources that other developers could benefit from, please share them! 

Note

Submissions should preferably include a video demonstration and/or a text walk-through, so that potential users don’t have to deploy a solution to understand what it does. Suggestions will be reviewed on the basis of clarity, functionality, and usefulness.

# Inclusivity Terms and Definitions

•	Intersectionality – How different aspects of a person’s identity (e.g. race, gender, socioeconomic status) intersect to create unique experiences of discrimination or privilege. 

•	Representation – The presence and participation of people from various identities and backgrounds in an organization or space.

•	Equitable Access – Ensuring all individuals have the necessary resources and opportunities to succeed, taking into account individual needs and systemic barriers. 

•	Universal design – Creating products, environments, and services that are usable by all people, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. 

•	Accommodation – Adjustments or modifications provided to individuals with disabilities to ensure equal access to opportunities. 

•	Assistive technology – Tools and devices designed to assist people with disabilities in performing tasks that might otherwise be difficult. 

•	Microaggressions – Subtle, often unintentional, comments or actions that reflect bias or stereotypes, which can be harmful to marginalized individuals. 

•	Digital accessibility – Ensuring websites, apps, and digital tools are usable by individuals with disabilities including compatibility with screen readers, closed captions, and keyboard navigation. 

•	ADA – Americans with Disabilities Act, which mandates equal access and accommodations for people with disabilities in public spaces, employment, and digital platforms. 

•	Screen Readers - Software applications that convert digital text on a screen into spoken words or braille output. They help individuals who are blind or visually impaired to navigate and interact with digital content, including websites, documents, and applications.

•	Speech-to-Text - A technology that converts spoken language into written text. It is often used for dictation, transcription, and providing real-time captions for individuals with hearing impairments or for convenience in various communication contexts.

•	Closed Captions - Text that appears on a video screen, representing the spoken words and other audio elements like sound effects. Closed captions are used to make video content accessible to people who are deaf or hard of hearing. For more information about closed captions in XR, please review the Community Discussion Series – Closed Captioning.   

•	Alternative Text - A brief description of an image or non-text element embedded in digital content. Alt text is used by screen readers to describe images to visually impaired users and to provide context if images fail to load.

•	Braille – A tactile writing system used by people who are blind or visually impaired. It consists of raised dots that represent letters, numbers, and punctuation marks, which can be read by touch.

•	Zoom Magnification - An accessibility feature that allows users to enlarge the content on their screen. It assists individuals with visual impairments by making text, images, and interface elements easier to see.

•	Voice Command – Technology that allows users to control devices, applications, or systems using voice instructions. It is commonly used in virtual assistants and accessibility tools for people with physical disabilities.

•	Sip-and-Puff System - An assistive technology that allows individuals with limited mobility to control devices by inhaling (sip) or exhaling (puff) into a tube. It is often used by people with quadriplegia to operate wheelchairs or computers.

•	Eye-Tracking - A technology that tracks where a user is looking and can be used as an input method. It is often employed in assistive technology to help individuals with severe mobility impairments control computers or communication devices by moving their eyes.
