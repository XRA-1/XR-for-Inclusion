# Project Overview 

The XR for Inclusivity project is a collection of resources hosted by XR Association (XRA), that provides a central place for developers to find solutions for creating projects that are accessible and represent all people. XRA is inspired by developers and XR programs and seeks to ensure that projects created for XR technology reflect authentic depictions of diverse communities and access to the programs are inclusive for all people. 

The XR Association promotes the dynamic global growth of the XR industry, which includes virtual reality, augmented reality, mixed-reality, and future immersive technology. XRA is leading the way for the responsible development and adoption of XR by convening stakeholders, developing best practices and research, and advocating on behalf of our members and the greater XR industry.

The XR Association represents the broad ecosystem of the XR industry including headset manufacturers, technology platforms, component and peripheral companies, internet infrastructure companies, enterprise solution providers, and corporate end-users. 

Diverse representation and accessible features are crucial to an XR experience because the program can be utilized by more individuals, which results in both business and creative benefits. Additionally, more representation of diverse communities in such immersive experiences is a significant factor because users will see themselves more in the program, resulting in a more personal and positive experience overall. 
Below you’ll find a summary of work stemming from the XRAC process, where XRA convened subject matter experts to discuss the most pressing issues facing immersive technology today, and accessibility was one of them. https://xra.org/xrac/

Contributions Welcome

The XR for Inclusion Project is open source. If you know of resources that other developers could benefit from, please share them! 

Note

Submissions should preferably include a video demonstration and/or a text walk-through, so that potential users don’t have to deploy a solution to understand what it does. Suggestions will be reviewed on the basis of clarity, functionality, and usefulness.
